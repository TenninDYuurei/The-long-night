            <div>
                    <p>If you're looking for sunshine and rainbows, then this book is not for you.</p>

                    <p>A collection of not-your-usual-kind of poetry written over the course of three years, and compiled into this short book.</p>

                    <p>What you see here is pain converted into art during some of my worst days, as a way to cope with or maybe just get rid of all the pent-up emotions. I can't tell you if it worked or not, but enjoy reading, you just might relate with some of them.</p>

                    <p>As the name implies, most of the poems have dark themes, but a few were thrown in here and there for comic relief coz being all dark and depressing is boring.</p>

                    <p>At the very least, I can guarantee that it will be a very enjoyable read, so have fun. </p>

                    <p>	Ovakporaye Joseph is a Nigerian writer who has written countless stories, poems, articles etc. and the long night is a compendium of some of his best poems. </p>
                        <p>The poems were written during some of his darkest days, as a way to cope with the pent up emotions. </p>
                        <p>In his words "I found out that reading them often helped cheer me up or at least lighten my mood whenever I was feeling down, so I decided to share them with as many as would want them." </p>
